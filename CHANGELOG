CHANGELOG

okay, so having figured out passing variables to osascript (tl;dr - build the applescript command then pipe it to /usr/bin/osascript)
and how to catch the "error" of the cancel button (osascript -so) in a useful way, the script here now can process:
base dialog text (mandatory) $$dialogText
default answer (optional, required for text entry from human) $default answer
hidden answer (show entered text as bullets, default is false as per standard additions)
buttons (optional) $buttons, this is an array, kind of a pain in the ass
default button (text, optional) mutually exclusive to...
default button (int, optional), this too was annoying to build out, but it works
title (text, optional)
iconEnum (text, optional)

we're well on our way to this module!

Got the iconEnum and iconPath working. Disabled iconText and iconInt because those refer to resource IDs and I don't think those are used the way they were a few decades annoying
All the supported parameters work, tested, so the script is done. it's a test script

version 1.0 of the module is done!
